# Web stack debugging #2
The user root is, on Linux, the “superuser”. It can do anything it wants, that’s a good and bad thing. A good practice is that one should never be logged in the root user, for example run rm -rf /, there is no comeback. That’s why it is preferable to run as a privileged user, meaning that the user also has the ability to perform tasks that the root user can do.
